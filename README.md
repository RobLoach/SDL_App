# SDL_app

Application wrapper for SDL.

## Introduction

When building an SDL application for desktop, mobile, and web, there are subtle differences to accomodate the application workflow. SDL_app aims to clean up those differences, and make the code easier to read for a unified application entry. This pattern is inspired by [sokol_app](https://github.com/floooh/sokol#sokol_apph).
